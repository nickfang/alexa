Realtor Assistant

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:

Create a amazon alexa app that helps relators despense information.  Start with the skill-sample-nodejs-city-guide example and go from there.  I want this to a little easier to add questions that people might ask.  To this end, create a python script that will generate javascript code for each intent in the intent schema.  This code will just pull response information from dynamoDB for each question.  Eventually, I imagine that there will be a web interface for realtors to be able to add questions and possible utterances as well as the expected responses.  For now setup it up like the example where the responses are global variables and then when that is working, implement with dynamoDB.
