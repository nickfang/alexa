Realtor Assistant

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY:

Create a amazon alexa app that helps relators despense information.  Start with the skill-sample-nodejs-city-guide example and go from there.  I want this to a little easier to add questions that people might ask.  To this end, create a python script that will generate javascript code for each intent in the intent schema.  This code will just pull response information from dynamoDB for each question.  Eventually, I imagine that there will be a web interface for realtors to be able to add questions and possible utterances as well as the expected responses.  For now setup it up like the example where the responses are global variables and then when that is working, implement with dynamoDB.

PRIORITIES:

Green
	Figure out folder structure
	Implement summary intent
	Implement asking price intent
	Implement square footage intent
	Python script for genenrating Intent Functinos and utterances

Yellow
	Store responses in dynamoDB

Red

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create an alexa app the allows a person to ask about information about a house.
Create a a sample that pulls data from a dynamoDB.  Eventually figure out how to pull data from MLS or import data from Relator.
Types of questions:
	What is the type of house.
	What is sq footage
	How many rooms
	how many bathrooms
	what is the price
	what is the county
	price per sq ft
	Relator Information

RESEARCH:

Do I need to create states for this app?
	Starting state - ask for a summary or any question about the house.
	Are there any questions that they need to answer yes or no to.  That should put them into another state.
	I could keep track of what has been asked and not include those in the help.  Then I would have two states.  NesWession and InSession.

If I want to add states, that makes it more difficult to codegen the intent handlers.
If I don't have multiple states, do I just use Alexa.handler?

Reponses (from alexa-sdk):
	NewSession
	LaunchRequest
	SessionEndRequest
		Call AMAZON.StopIntent

	AMAZON.HelpIntent
		"You can ask about " + <buid array of possible intents - codegen from dynamoDB>
	AMAZON.RepeatIntent
	AMAZON.StopIntent
	AMAZON.StartOverIntent
	AMAZON.CancelIntent

	Welcome
		"Welcome to " + address + ".  What would you like to know about this location?"
	<intent>
		codegen from dynamoDB or pull from dynamoDB? Seems like doing a codegen from dynamoDB would be better since we wouldn't be hitting the database as much.  We definitely have to codegen to create the intent handler, so might as well put the response in the function while we're at it.
	unhandled
		make sure and log the session info to get an idea of what they were trying to ask about

Do I need any slots for generated intents?
