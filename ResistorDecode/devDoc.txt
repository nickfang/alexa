Resistor Decode


Resistor Parallel/Series
	Calculate the resistance of two resistors.
	Info for Intent:
		Parallel/Series
		Reistor 1
		Reistor 2

	Resistor 1 can be a resistor from a previous decode.  Store last resistor value.

	Possible paths to get all the info needed to calculate the resistance.
		res1 or res2 can be [valid, invalid, missing]),
		lastresistor can be [valid, missing] (saved to sessionAttributes, not getting it from AVS so it won't be invalid)

		{orientation: valid, res1: valid, res2: valid, lastresistor: *}
			calculate resistance with res1 and res2

		{orientation: valid, res1: valid, res2: missing, lastresistor: valid}
			calculate resistance with res1 and lastresistor

		{orientation: invalid, res1: *, res2: *, lastresistor: *}
			reprompt for orientation

		{orientation: valid, res1: valid, res2: invalid, lastresistor: *}
			// assume that the user wants to calculate based off two values stated.
			reprompt for resistor value

		{orientation: valid, res1: invalid, res2: valid, lastresistor: *}
			// assume that the user wants to calculate based off two values stated.
			reprompt for resistor value

		{orientation: valid, res1: invalid, res2: invalid, lastresistor: valid}
			reprompt for resistor value

		{orientation: valid, res1: invalid, res2: invalid, lastresistor: missing}
			reprompt for two resistor values?

		{orientation: missing, res1: missing, res2: missing, lastresistor: *}
			// missing everything so easier to have them restate what they want instead of prompting
			state help message

		{orientation: invalid, res1: invalid, res2: invalid, lastresistor: *}
			// misheard everything so better to restate
			state help message
