TODO:
	Create a standard word to log when there is an error and error numbers
	stop logging isResistorValueValid(): && isOrientationValueValid(): Only necessary when debugging.
	Make sure the <function name>(): is only called at the beginning of the function.


Summary:

Features:
	g - color lookup
	g - color decode
	g - parallel and series resistance

	y - detect prefix multipliers and figure out the right resistor value
	y - color decode with 4 color bars.  (needs to still work for 3 color bars.)
	y - add option to use decoded resistor or not.  Currently we use the decoded resistor if you previously decoded a resistor and only provide one resistor and the orientation afterwards.

	r - random information.

Functions


Color Decode


Resistor Decode


Resistor Parallel/Series
	Calculate the resistance of two resistors.
	Info for Intent:
		Parallel/Series
		Reistor 1
		Reistor 2

	Resistor 1 can be a resistor from a previous decode.  Store last resistor value.

	Possible paths to get all the info needed to calculate the resistance.
		res1 or res2 can be [valid, invalid, missing]),
		lastresistor can be [valid, missing] (saved to sessionAttributes, not getting it from AVS so it won't be invalid)

		{orientation: valid, res1: valid, res2: valid, lastresistor: *}
			calculate resistance with res1 and res2

		{orientation: valid, res1: valid, res2: missing, lastresistor: valid}
			calculate resistance with res1 and lastresistor

		{orientation: invalid, res1: *, res2: *, lastresistor: *}
			reprompt for orientation

		{orientation: valid, res1: valid, res2: invalid, lastresistor: *}
			// assume that the user wants to calculate based off two values stated.
			reprompt for resistor value

		{orientation: valid, res1: invalid, res2: valid, lastresistor: *}
			// assume that the user wants to calculate based off two values stated.
			reprompt for resistor value

		{orientation: valid, res1: invalid, res2: invalid, lastresistor: valid}
			reprompt for resistor value

		{orientation: valid, res1: invalid, res2: invalid, lastresistor: missing}
			reprompt for two resistor values?

		{orientation: missing, res1: missing, res2: missing, lastresistor: *}
			// missing everything so easier to have them restate what they want instead of prompting
			state help message

		{orientation: invalid, res1: invalid, res2: invalid, lastresistor: *}
			// misheard everything so better to restate
			state help message

Add another intent for if someone wants to use the decoded resistor value in the calculation?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

when a reprompt is needed for:

orientation 	resistorA	resistorB
true				true			true				call handleGetHelpRequest()
true				false			true				reprompt for an orientation and a resistor value.
true				true			false				--should not happen.  resistorB get's moved to resistorA if there's no resistorA.--
true				false			false				reprompt for an orientation
false 			true			true				reprompt for two resistor value
false				false			true				reprompt for a resistor value
false				true			false				--should not happen.  resistorB get's moved to resistorA if there's no resistorA.--
false				false			false				pass through

From here, I have 5 different reprompts.
and one that calls handleGetHelpRequest()
and one that just passes through.
