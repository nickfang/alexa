<h2><strong>Resistor Assistant:</strong></h2>
<p>This is a simple app that assists you with decoding the three color bands on resistors as well as calculating the effective resistance of two resistors in parallel or series.  It is possible to use the decoded resistor as one of the resistances in the series or parallel calcuation.  If you do not provide enough information for calculating the effective resistance, this app will prompt you for the missing information.</p>

<p>In the tools folder, there is a python script for processing log files downloaded from AWS.</p>
